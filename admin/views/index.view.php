                This is the first version of The Master Blog, it is still in beta, so it could contain bugs or grammar errors. Made in 40 hours of work, developed as a personal project without any intention to be a professional project.

                Most of it done with HTML5, CSS + SCSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL. Although it also contains frameworks like Bootstrap 4, AOS and jQuery.
